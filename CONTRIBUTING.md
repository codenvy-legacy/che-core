Contributing to Eclipse Che
=====================

Before Submitting an Issue
--------------------------
Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/codenvy/che-core/issues)
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. Do *not* leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they
only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help
resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests
---------------------------------------------
Please file a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not file combo issues.

The more information you can provide, the more likley someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. Therefore:
* Provide reproducibule steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you would have expected.
* A detailed description of the behavior that you expect.
* Animated GIFs are a tremendous help.
* Version information of Eclipse Che and Docker.
* Error outputs that may exist in your browser console.
