/**
 * Describes port application port mapping. If run multiple application on the same instance we are not able to share the same port
 * numbers. In this case we use forwarding of traffic between application ports and public ports available for access from internet.
 * Typically user knows which ports he needs but if we use forwarding he mayn't know which public port we map for his application.
 * PortMapping helps to resolve such issues. For example if user deploy application in tomcat he expect to see application on port 8080 but
 * in fact we use any free port, for instance 43987. Port mapping specified us mapping String to String to be able add protocol for the
 * port (e.g 22/tcp), but this is implementation specific. Private ports are used as keys and public ports as values in the port {@code
 * Map}.
